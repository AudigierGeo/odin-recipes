    <h2>A somewhat sensible page of pancakes</h2>

    <p>Pancakes should really be a staple in everyones life, they are easy to cook, enrish the soul and can be adapted to any taste</p>

    <p>My personal favourite are thick american style pancakes with bacon or sausage and maple syrup, but the thin British ones are also a delight</p>

    <ul> 
        <li>Self raising flour</li>

        <li>Melted butter</li>
        <li>Yoghurt</li>
